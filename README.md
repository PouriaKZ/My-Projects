web developing projects as a junior!

Hello there!

This is Pouria. I've been an extreme fan of technology spacially computers, and now It's been about a year that I've started learning front-end web developing.
Just a beginner now, but I'll try my best to become a senior ASAP.
"JS" is the most challenging!
Glad to recieve any help whatsoever, thanks!
